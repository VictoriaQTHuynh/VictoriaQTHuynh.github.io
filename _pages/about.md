    excerpt: "I volunteered in this program for the last 8 years. **Cycle** is a children's charity that rewards students with new bicycles for achieving better academic performance in the classroom. The young students earn a bicycle before Christmas break for achieving their set goals. The mission of the program is to improve 2nd grade literacy at Title One schools in the Greater Houston area. Every year many companies in the Houston areas donate the bikes and the volunteers help put them together and deliver them to the students at the schools before Christmas. I love to see the smiles on the kids' faces when they pick out their bike and sit on it for the first time. "

I have been working in tech industry for over a decade and currently lead a team of data scientists. Throughout my career I have the opportunites to work with customers from many industries listed above, and learn about their business.  I love to learn about the complexity of each business and how they operate differently with different constraints and objectives.  It's my passion to apply data science to solve these business problems, especially to figure out how the same models can be applied across industries.
