I have been working in tech industry for over a decade and currently lead a team of data scientists. Throughout my career I have the opportunites to work with customers from many industries listed above, and learn about their business.  I love to learn about the complexity of each business and how they operate differently with different constraints and objectives.  It's my passion to apply data science to solve these business problems, especially to figure out how the same models can be applied across industries.
