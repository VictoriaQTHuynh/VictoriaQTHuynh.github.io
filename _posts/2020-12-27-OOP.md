Object-Oriented programming or Procedural programming? One extensively uses procedures or functions which perform specific tasks; the other revolves around objects instead of procedures.
Only you can answer this age-old question and pick your preference. In this post, I'll explain the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming with simple examples.

## Class and Object
Examples of **objects**:
An object could represent a person with **properties** such as name, age, address, etc., and with **behaviors** such as walking, talking, breathing, running, etc.
An object could represent an email with **properties** such as recipient list, subject, body, etc., and with **behaviors** such as adding attachments, sending, etc.

# Image placed on the Left
{% include feature_row id="feature_row_left" type="left" %}

# Image placed on the Right
{% include feature_row id="feature_row_right" type="right" %}

# Image placed on the Center
{% include feature_row id="feature_row_center" type="center" %}

# Three Images side by side
{% include feature_row %}

# Ways to insert images
## Size as is
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/train.jpg" alt="tree">

## Adjust image size
<div style="width:20%; font-size:80%; text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/train.jpg" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>
</div>
