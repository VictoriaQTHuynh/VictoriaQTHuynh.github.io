Object-Oriented programming or Procedural programming? One extensively uses procedures or functions which perform specific tasks; the other revolves around objects instead of procedures.
Only you can answer this age-old question and pick your preference. In this post, I'll explain the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming with simple examples.

Table of Content (manually)
- [Abstraction](#abstractopm)
- [Encapsulation](#encapsulation)
- [Inheritance](#inheritance)
- [Polymorphism](#polymorphism)


### Class and Objects
Examples of **objects**:
- An object could represent a person with **properties** such as name, age, address, etc., and with **behaviors** such as walking, talking, breathing, running, etc.
- An object could represent an email with **properties** such as recipient list, subject, body, etc., and with **behaviors** such as adding attachments, sending, etc.

Another example of *Class* and *object*:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/OOP/class_JL.png" alt="class_JL">

### Why do you want to use OOP?
For example, you want to create a program that deals with various geometric shapes. Each shape has some common properties such as color of the shape, whether the shape will be filled or not, calculate the area or the perimeter of the shapes, etc. 

{% include feature_row id="feature_row_center" type="center" %}

You can do this the procedural way:

<div style="width:70%; font-size:80%; text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/OOP/rect_circle_2.png" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>
</div> 

<br />
Or you could try the object-oriented approach:

<div style="width:70%; font-size:80%; text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/OOP/rect_circle_3.png" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>
</div> 

They both will give the same results. Which option do you prefer? What if you need to repeat for each geometric shape? Can you identify the redundancy with the first option?

# Four Basic Principles of Object-Oriented Programming

{% include feature_row id="feature_row_center_OOP" type="center" %}


## Abstraction

Abstraction allows us to bundle together some related things and give a name to that bundle.  Once that bundle is named, we can refer to it and, at times, ignore the details within the bundle.  


## Encapsulation

Encapsulation restricts access to methods and variables, and can prevent the data from being modified by accident.


## Inheritance

Inheritance is the process by which one class takes on the attributes and methods of another. 
- Newly formed classes are called Child classes. 
- The classes that Child classes are derived from are called Parent classes. 
- Child classes override or extend the functionality (e.g., attributes and behaviors) of parents classes. 
  - Child classes inherit all of the Parent’s attributes and behaviors but also specify different behaviors to follow. 
  - Child classes can inherit from a single Parent class or multiple Parent classes.


## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows 2 or more objects to behave like one another, which allows them to be used interchangeably. It can be utilized when there are commonly named methods across classes. It allows functions to use objects of any of these polymorphic classes without needing to be aware of distinctions across the classes.  It can be carried out through inheritance, with child classes making use of parent class methods or overriding them.






















# Image placed on the Left
{% include feature_row id="feature_row_left" type="left" %}

# Image placed on the Right
{% include feature_row id="feature_row_right" type="right" %}

# Image placed on the Center
{% include feature_row id="feature_row_center" type="center" %}

# Three Images side by side
{% include feature_row %}

# Ways to insert images
## Size as is
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/train.jpg" alt="tree">

## Adjust image size
<div style="width:20%; font-size:80%; text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/train.jpg" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>
</div>
