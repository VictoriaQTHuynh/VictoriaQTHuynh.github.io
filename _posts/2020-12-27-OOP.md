It allows functions to use objects of any of these polymorphic classes without needing to be aware of distinctions across the classes.  It can be carried out through inheritance, with child classes making use of parent class methods or overriding them."

Object-Oriented programming or Procedural programming? One extensively uses procedures or functions which perform specific tasks; the other revolves around objects instead of procedures.
Only you can answer this age-old question and pick your preference. In this post, I'll explain the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming with simple examples.

# Why do you want to use OOP?
Suppose you want to write a program that deals with various geometric shapes. Each shape has some common properties such as color of the shape, whether the shape will be filled or not, calculate the area or the perimeter of the shapes, etc. 

{% include feature_row id="feature_row_center" type="center" %}

You could do this the procedural way:

<div style="width:70%; font-size:80%; text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/OOP/rect_circle_2.png" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>
</div> 

<br />
Or you could try the object-oriented approach:

<div style="width:70%; font-size:80%; text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/OOP/rect_circle_3.png" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>
</div> 

They both will give the same results. Which option do you prefer? What if you need to repeat for each geometric shape? Can you identify the redundancy with the first option?

## Abstraction

Abstraction allows us to **bundle together some related things** and give a name to that bundle.  Once that bundle is named, we can refer to it and, at times, ignore the details within the bundle.  

**Procedural Abstraction**: one way we “abstract” is by bundling together statements into functions, i.e., take a bundle of code and give it a name, run the code by referring to the name of the function.  This way instead of a program consisting of thousands of statements, it can consist of tens or hundreds of functions, each of which consists of ten or so statements.

```python
   def function_name
   	    statement1
      	statement2
          …
      	statementN
```

**Data Abstraction**: just as there are related statements that can be bundled together, there are also related variables that can be bundled together. Instead of a program having hundreds or thousands of variables, it can have ten or twenty, with each variable having multiple fields.  For example, Facebook’s data related to a person – name, address, email, etc.
- The program could define separate variables for each of these.
  
```python
    firstName = ‘John’
    lastName = ‘Doe’
    email = ‘john_doe_123@gmail.com’
    friends = []
```  
  
- Or can create an abstraction for a person and define the data for as fields within that abstraction.

```python
    Person
        firstName = ‘John’
        lastName = ‘Doe’
        email = ‘john_doe_123@gmail.com’
        friends = []
```

### Class and Instance

**Classes** are used to create new user-defined data structures that contain arbitrary information about something.  For example, Class JusticeLeague contains properties and behaviors of different superhero characters.  We can think of Class as an idea or blueprint for how something should be defined.

**Instance** or object is a copy of the Class with actual values.  For example, Batman, Superman, Aquaman are instances of Class JusticeLeague.  We can think of a Class is like a form or questionnaire.  It defines the needed information. After you fill out the form, your specific copy is an Instance of the Class; it contains actual information relevant to you.

Examples of **instances** or **objects**:
- An object could represent a person with **properties** such as name, age, address, etc., and with **behaviors** such as walking, talking, breathing, running, etc.
- An object could represent an email with **properties** such as recipient list, subject, body, etc., and with **behaviors** such as adding attachments, sending, etc.

**Example**: Class JusticeLeague

### 1. Instance Attributes
All classes create instances or objects. All instances contain characteristics called attributes (properties). Use the __init__() method to initialize an object’s initial attributes by giving them their default value (or state).

<div style="width:40%; font-size:80%; text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/OOP/dog1.png" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>
</div> 

### 2. Class Attributes
Instance attributes are specific to each object. Class attributes are the same for all instances – which in this case for all dogs. While each dog has a unique name and age, every dog will be a mammal.

<div style="width:50%; font-size:80%; text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/OOP/dog2.png" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>
</div> 

##### Example: Rocky and Mikey

<div style="width:80%; font-size:80%; text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/OOP/dog3.png" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>
</div> 

##### Example: Beau, Ace, and Lucy

<div style="width:80%; font-size:80%; text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/OOP/dog4.png" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>
</div> 

### 3. Instance Methods
Instance methods are defined inside a class and are used to get the contents of an instance.  It can be used to perform operations with the attributes of the objects. Instance methods in classes should use self as the name of the first parameter (which refers to the object).

<div style="width:70%; font-size:80%; text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/OOP/dog5.png" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>
</div> 


## Encapsulation
Encapsulation restricts access to methods and variables, and can prevent the data from being modified by accident.

#### Private Methods
<div style="width:80%; font-size:80%; text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/OOP/dog_encap_1.png" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>
</div> 

#### Private Variables
A private variable can only be changed within a class method and not outside of the class.  Objects could hold crucial data and you do not want that data to be changed from anywhere in the code.

<div style="width:80%; font-size:80%; text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/OOP/dog_encap_2.png" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>
</div> 

If you want to change the value of a private variable, a setter method can be used.

<div style="width:35%; font-size:80%; text-align:center;">
<img src="/images/OOP/dog_encap_3.png" style="padding-bottom:0.5em;"/>
</div> 


## Inheritance

Inheritance is the process by which one class takes on the attributes and methods of another. 
- Newly formed classes are called Child classes. 
- The classes that Child classes are derived from are called Parent classes. 
- Child classes override or extend the functionality (e.g., attributes and behaviors) of parents classes. 
  - Child classes inherit all of the Parent’s attributes and behaviors but also specify different behaviors to follow. 
  - Child classes can inherit from a single Parent class or multiple Parent classes.

Some light humor: from Homer and Marge Simpson "parent classes", you could have Bart and Lisa Simpson "child classes".

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows 2 or more objects to behave like one another, which allows them to be used interchangeably. It can be utilized when there are commonly named methods across classes. It allows functions to use objects of any of these polymorphic classes without needing to be aware of distinctions across the classes.  It can be carried out through inheritance, with child classes making use of parent class methods or overriding them.
